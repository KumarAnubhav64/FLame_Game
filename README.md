# Flame_Game
# Made Using Pyhton and Kivy Framework this is my first project.

#To use this first clone repo then simply goto gitbash and start virtual enviroment by using commad
# source /your_parent_direcotry/Flame_Game/flames/Scripts/activate
# then in virtual enviroment run file by python Screen.py

#if you are having trouble in setting up virtual enviromnet then just just install kivy directly by:

#  pip install kivy
